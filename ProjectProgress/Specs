1. Target

The game is a 2D platformer featuring a female warrior protagonist on a mission to save the world. Armed with a sword, the player can defeat monsters while utilizing impressive jumping abilities to traverse walls and leap across cliffs. The playerâ€™s health is represented by hearts, which deplete with enemy damage or environmental hazards like falling off cliffs. A timer adds pressure, and if either health or time runs out, the game ends with a "Game Over" screen.

To assist the player, there are collectable hearts that restore health, and invincibility power-ups to temporarily bypass danger. The adventure starts on a world map, where players can navigate through different stages by walking to the designated icons and pressing 'Z' to enter.

Each level introduces unique environments and challenges:

Level 1 (Cave): A straightforward platforming challenge featuring bats that swoop in to attack and skeletons that block the player's progress with shields, launching sword attacks from a distance.

Level 2 (Forest): Players climb vines and avoid mushroom enemies hiding in the grass, along with goblins that attack quickly and evade player strikes.

Level 3 (Dungeon): A more puzzle-oriented environment where players must break rocks to advance and face off against all enemy types, culminating in a boss battle.

The game's mechanics combine combat, platforming, and puzzle-solving, providing a balanced and engaging experience.
