Welcome to the repository for my 2D platformer game, built using the Unity engine. This repository contains all the assets, scripts, and documentation for the development of the game.

Repository Contents
Assets Folder: This is the main folder where all game development occurs. It includes:

Animations: All player and enemy animations used in the game.

Sprites: Visual assets like characters, backgrounds, and UI elements.

C# Scripts: Game logic controlling player movement, enemy interactions, UI, and gameplay mechanics.

Imported Assets: Assets brought in from the Unity Asset Store, such as sound effects, textures, and other utility tools.

ProjectProgress Folder: Contains documentation related to the development timeline, including:

Timetables: Details my progress on the game, showing hours worked on specific tasks.

Specifications: Information on system requirements to run the game, including recommended and minimum specs.

Overview
This repository serves as the base for my Unity game, where most of the development is focused on the Assets folder. The Scripts folder inside it holds all the core code responsible for gameplay mechanics, such as player controls, enemy AI, interactions, and menu management.

Future Updates
As development progresses, updates will continue to focus on refining the game mechanics, adding new levels, improving performance, and expanding the documentation found in the ProjectProgress folder.
