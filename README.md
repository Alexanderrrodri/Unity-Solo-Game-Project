In the Assets folder is where most of my changes will be in and the other folders just contain data needed for Unity.
I have labeled my animations, sprites, c# scripts, my imported assets from the unity store in seperate folders inside Assets.
Most of my code is in the Scripts file in Assets, and is resonsible for the player movement, enemy interaction, menu options and etc.
